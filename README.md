# Maya-Trial-1

Goal: make landscape with variable heights, trees and vegetation and maybe water?

•make heatmap for landscape
•let heatmap decide height of each part of landscape
•let trees grow above a certain height
•let grass colour change based on height (because of water being in the lower parts makes it so they're brighter green?)


Additional notes:
trees procedurally generated?
How do I do water???
